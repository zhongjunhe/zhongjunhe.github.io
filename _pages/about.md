HE Zhongjun is the Chair of Baidu Artificial Intelligence Technical Committee. He received his PhD degree from the Institute of Computing Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2008. His research focuses on machine translation and natural language processing. He currently leads [Baidu Translate](https://fanyi.baidu.com) at [Natural Language Processing Department](https://nlp.baidu.com/homepage/index). He co-organized [the First Workshop on Simultaneous Translation](https://simultrans-workshop.github.io) at ACL-20. He serves AACL-2020 as Area co-chair and will serve ACL-2021 as Remote Presentation co-chair.
